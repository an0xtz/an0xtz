## Declaration I - Anonymity

We are an0xtz. We are faceless. We are nameless. We are unimportant.

focused.art must stand on it's own. We will not let our personas, names, or reputations corrupt public opinion of focused.art. We have no objectives or motives. We are nothing. Art is everything.

## Declaration II - A Return to Art

We develop focused.art as the name implies, a return to focusing on art.

We will never develop or implement any features which diverge from this declaration -- for instance, we will never have leaderboards driven by marketplace activity or filters that sort by marketplace activity.

## Declaration III - Free as in Freedom

All focused.art code, smart contracts, etc will be released under the MIT open source license.

To the extent possible, all focused.art assets, imagery, and branding will be released under the CC0 "no rights reserved" license.

We will not hold admin keys over the contracts. Any admin rights required to bootstrap the contracts will be burned, and the contracts will run forever, adminless and permisionless. You will never be required to trust us.

We can never take the platform offline. We can never block anyone accessing it. And neither can anyone else. Trustless and censorship resistant.

## Declaration IV - Free as in Free

focused.art will never collect any platform or service fees on any transactions. The cost to sell on the focused.art marketplace will always be 0%. The contracts will never allow it to be changed.

We will seek funding as needed to "keep the lights on" through the traditional open source model of donations. You may choose to donate on transactions. It will never be forced.

## Declaration V - Art is an experiment

We believe that art is an experiment. And we believe that coding is a form of art. focused.art is an experiment. We believe that moving fast and breaking things is the best way to experiment. We will not wait for perfection to release the platform or new features. We will release incrementally and often.
